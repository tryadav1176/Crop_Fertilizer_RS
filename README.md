# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

Introduction

The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in making informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer usage. By analyzing soil properties, weather conditions, and other environmental factors, this system aims to boost agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Features

Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil characteristics and environmental parameters.

Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends the optimal fertilizer for the selected crop to enhance growth and yield.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input data and view recommendations.

Data Analysis and Visualization: Offers insights through charts and graphs to better understand the recommendations.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

Pandas, NumPy: For data processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization

How It Works

Data Collection:

Users provide inputs such as soil type, nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) levels, and weather conditions.

Historical and real-time data can also be integrated.

Model Training:

Machine learning models are trained on datasets containing soil, crop, and fertilizer information.

Algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks are employed.

Prediction:

Based on the input, the system predicts the best crop and fertilizer combination.
